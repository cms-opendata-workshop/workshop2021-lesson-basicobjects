take lesson information about triggers / reconstruction / identification / isolation to build selection criteria (trigger + ID + isolation) for different physics scenarios like "reconstruct H -> ZZ -> 4 leptons", versus "reject electrons in a H -> gamma gamma search". Grab 2-3 diverse publications from Run 1 to compare their ideas to what the analyzers chose.
