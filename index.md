FIXME: home page introduction

Outline of this lesson:
 * Basics of all physics objects (4-vectors, etc)
 * Basics of EGamma objects 
 * Basics of Muons and taus (common in the sense that most IDs/isos are pre-configured)
 * Basics of Jets and MET
 * Basics of Triggers

Challenge / HW Idea: take lesson information about reconstruction / identification / isolation to build selection criteria for different physics scenarios like "reconstruct H -> ZZ -> 4 leptons", versus "reject electrons in a H -> gamma gamma search". Grab 2-3 diverse publications from Run 1 to compare their ideas to what the analyzers chose.
