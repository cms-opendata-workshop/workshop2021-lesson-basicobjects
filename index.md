FIXME: home page introduction

Outline of this lesson:
 * Basics of all physics objects (4-vectors, etc)
 * Basics of EGamma objects 
 * Basics of Muons and taus (common in the sense that most IDs/isos are pre-configured)
 * Basics of Jets and MET
 * Basics of Triggers

Prep work: Read episodes 1/2/3

Demo/Q's (45 mins):
 * Answer Q's on prep (15 mins)
 * Walk through Episodes 4/5 on more complicated things (15 mins JME, 15 mins trigger)

Hands-on:
 * episode 06-handson.md
 * Muon or tau or jet ID exericse (everybody picks one?)
 * Real-vs-fake MET exercise
 * Trigger exercise?

Challenge:
 * episode 07-challenge.md
 * take lesson information about triggers / reconstruction / identification / isolation to build selection criteria (trigger + ID + isolation) for different physics scenarios like "reconstruct H -> ZZ -> 4 leptons", versus "reject electrons in a H -> gamma gamma search". Grab 2-3 diverse publications from Run 1 to compare their ideas to what the analyzers chose.
